## Labitat Code of Conduct

We are committed to making Labitat an inclusive
and welcoming space for everyone at all times.
The most important rule is: be excellent to each other.

Sadly, technology communities have a notorious reputation for harassment.
We've set these ground rules to make it clear that this behaviour is unacceptable
so everyone can feel comfortable being part of Labitat.

Everyone who visits Labitat must abide by this code of conduct,
both in the physical space and on any online channels.
We will not tolerate harassment of participants or discriminatory behaviour of
any form.
Specifically:

* Do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist,
  or otherwise prejudiced behaviour.

* Do not harass people.
  Stalking, unconsented physical contact, or unwanted sexual attention
  is harassment.
  Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent.

* Labitat is a shared space, but every participant's personal space
  is their own.
  If you are asked to leave someone alone, you must respect this.

* Some members may not want to be filmed or photographed.
  Respect their wishes and always ask before you use a camera.

* Aggression and elitism are unwelcome;
  nobody should be afraid to ask questions.

We expect everyone to treat the space, bunkers and garden as well as tools
and infrastructure with the utmost care and respect.
We will not tolerate any kind of vandalism, including littering.

We may expel you or issue a time-out if you break these rules.
The decision is made by the board and can be tried at the annual general
meeting.

If you are being harassed or witness a breach of this code of conduct,
do not hesitate to write an email to conduct@labitat.dk.
